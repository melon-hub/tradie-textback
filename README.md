# Tradie Textback - Missed Call Management System

A React TypeScript application that helps Australian tradies capture leads by automatically sending SMS responses to missed calls.

## Overview

Tradie Textback helps Australian tradies win more jobs by automatically texting back missed calls, linking customers to a simple intake form, and organising requests in a mobile-friendly dashboard.

## Features

- Auto-SMS for missed calls (Twilio)
- Simple job intake form for customers
- Job dashboard with statuses and notes
- Client vs tradie views with proper access
- Mobile-first UI (Tailwind + shadcn)
- Secure backend (Supabase Auth + RLS)

## Live Demo

- Lovable project: https://lovable.dev/projects/17ebc76a-2297-472d-aba2-aae2d54dd873
  - Note: demo may use test data and limited features

## Quick Start (Local)

```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
npm i
npm run dev
```

For backend setup (Supabase, Twilio, Google Maps) see:
- docs/critical/database-setup.md
- docs/guides/GOOGLE_MAPS_INTEGRATION.md
- docs/google-api-security.md

> Note: This repository avoids exposing secrets. Never commit service_role keys. Frontend uses anon keys; database access is protected by RLS policies.
