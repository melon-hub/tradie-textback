### Quality Assurance Results

**Unit Tests**: ✅ 106/106 PASSING
```bash
Test Files  9 passed (9)
Tests       106 passed (106)
Duration    1.57s
```

**Build Process**: ✅ SUCCESSFUL
- Fixed duplicate export issue in TwilioErrorDisplay
- Production build completed successfully
- Bundle size: 1.4MB (acceptable for feature-rich app)

**E2E Test Detection**: ✅ CONFIRMED
- 30 onboarding-specific tests detected by Playwright
- Tests cover both desktop and mobile scenarios
- Proper test isolation and cleanup

**TypeScript Compliance**: ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT
- 205 ESLint errors (mostly TypeScript `any` types)
- 34 warnings (mostly React hooks dependencies)
- **Note**: Errors are quality-of-life improvements, not functionality blockers

## 🔧 Developer Experience Improvements

### Enhanced Dev Tools

1. **Streamlined Testing Workflow**
   - One-click login as any test user
   - Automatic navigation to appropriate onboarding step
   - Preset data for consistent testing scenarios

2. **Comprehensive Test Data**
   - Covers all Australian states and major cities
   - Different business models and trade types
   - Realistic edge cases and variations

3. **Professional Documentation**
   - Clear setup instructions in SQL comments
   - User login credentials clearly displayed
   - Step-by-step testing guidance

### Developer Setup Requirements

**Database Setup:**
1. Run migration: `supabase/migrations/20250803100000_onboarding_schema.sql`
2. Execute test data: `scripts/create-onboarding-test-data.sql`
3. Verify users in Supabase Auth dashboard

**Dev Environment:**
- Dev Drawer automatically detects development mode
- Test users only appear in development (not demo mode)
- All test user credentials: `testpass123`
