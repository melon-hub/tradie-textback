# Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Overview
Phase 1 of the onboarding implementation has been successfully completed with enhanced security measures.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Schema Design ✅
Created comprehensive migration with:
- **Enhanced Profiles Table**: Added 18 new columns for trade, business, and onboarding data
- **Trade Types Table**: Master reference with 10 trade types
- **Service Locations Table**: Postcode-based service areas with surcharges
- **SMS Templates Table**: 7 template types with variable substitution
- **Twilio Settings Table**: Secure design without storing credentials

### 2. Security Enhancement ✅
- **Original Issue**: Initial design stored Twilio auth_token in database
- **Solution**: Created secure version that stores credentials in Supabase Vault
- **Result**: `20250803100000_onboarding_schema_secure.sql` with vault integration

### 3. Migration Preparation ✅
Created ready-to-execute chunks in `scripts/migration-chunks/`:
- chunk1-extensions-profiles.sql
- chunk2-tables.sql
- chunk3-sms-templates.sql
- chunk4-twilio-secure.sql
- chunk5-indexes.sql
- chunk6-triggers.sql
- chunk7-rls.sql
- chunk8-data.sql
- chunk9-security-functions.sql

### 4. Documentation ✅
- Created detailed application guide: `scripts/apply-onboarding-migration.md`
- Updated implementation plan with progress
- Created this summary document

## Key Features Implemented

### Enhanced Profile Fields
- Trade classification (primary/secondary)
- Business details (name, ABN)
- Service areas (postcodes or radius)
- Credentials (license, insurance)
- Experience and specializations
- Onboarding tracking (step 0-10)
- Communication preferences

### New Tables
1. **trade_types**: plumber, electrician, carpenter, hvac, handyman, landscaper, locksmith, painter, tiler, roofer
2. **service_locations**: Postcode-specific service delivery with travel time and surcharges
3. **tenant_sms_templates**: Customizable SMS templates per tradie
4. **twilio_settings**: Secure phone configuration (credentials in Vault)

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- Vault integration for Twilio credentials
- Proper foreign key constraints
- Check constraints for data validation

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Apply Migration**: Run chunks 1-9 in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Generate Types**: Run `sdb-types` after migration
3. **Configure Vault**: Set up Twilio credentials in Supabase Vault

### Phase 2 Preview
- Fix DevAuthSwitch memoization
- Remove window.location.reload()
- Add onboarding test presets
- Enhance deep links with context

## Migration Application Instructions

1. Open Supabase SQL Editor
2. Execute each chunk file in order (1-9)
3. Verify with provided SQL queries
4. Update migration history if needed
5. Generate new TypeScript types

## Files Created
- `/supabase/migrations/20250803100000_onboarding_schema.sql` (original)
- `/supabase/migrations/20250803100000_onboarding_schema_secure.sql` (secure version)
- `/scripts/migration-chunks/` (9 chunk files)
- `/scripts/apply-onboarding-migration.md` (guide)
- `/docs/PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` (this file)

## Time Invested
Approximately 2-3 hours as estimated, including security enhancements.
