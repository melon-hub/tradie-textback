# Production Readiness Checklist: tradie-textback

This checklist assesses the application's readiness for a production launch based on a review of the codebase.

**Overall Verdict:** Strong MVP candidate, but **not yet production-ready**. Critical gaps exist in security, reliability, observability, and compliance that must be addressed before launch.

---

### Gate 1: Security
- [ ] **TLS/HTTPS everywhere:** ✅ **Likely Pass.** (Handled by Supabase and modern hosting providers).
- [ ] **OWASP Top-10:** 🟡 **Partial Pass.** (Good baseline protection from React/Supabase, but needs full verification).
- [ ] **Secrets in env vars / vault:** 🟡 **Partial Pass.** (Good practices followed, but Google Maps API key needs referrer restrictions).
- [ ] **RBAC & least-privilege:** 🟡 **Partial Pass.** (Client-side checks are present; server-side RLS policies need verification).
- [ ] **Rate limiting / brute-force protection:** ✅ **Likely Pass.** (Handled by Supabase).
- [ ] **Dependency scan:** ❌ **FAIL.** (`npm audit` found 7 vulnerabilities. **Action required: Run `npm audit fix`**).
- [ ] **CSP & Security Headers:** ❌ **FAIL.** (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc., are not set. **Action required**).
- [ ] **GDPR / CCPA:** ❌ **FAIL.** (No consent management or privacy policy. **Action required**).

### Gate 2: Reliability & Performance
- [ ] **E2E happy-path tests:** 🟡 **Partial Pass.** (Setup exists, but test coverage is unverified. **Action required: Write and automate tests**).
- [ ] **Automated rollback strategy:** ❌ **FAIL.** (Deployment is manual. **Action required: Implement CI/CD with rollback plan**).

- [ ] **Keyboard navigation & no blocking modals:** ✅ **Pass.**

### Gate 4: Data & Compliance

- [ ] **Stateless app servers:** ✅ **Pass.** (Client-side app is stateless by nature).
- [ ] **DB connection pool:** ✅ **Likely Pass.** (Handled by Supabase).
- [ ] **Scheduled cost review:** ❌ **FAIL.** (This is a business process that needs to be established).

### Gate 8: Documentation & Runbooks
