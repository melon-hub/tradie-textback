## Technical Achievements

### Database Architecture
**New Tables Added**:
1. **trade_types**: 10 trade classifications with urgency levels
2. **service_locations**: Postcode-based service delivery with surcharges
3. **tenant_sms_templates**: Customizable SMS templates (7 types)
4. **twilio_settings**: Secure phone configuration (Vault integration)

**Enhanced Profiles**: 18 new fields including trade classification, business info, service areas, credentials, onboarding tracking, and communication preferences.

### Security Improvements
- **Vault Integration**: Twilio credentials stored securely in Supabase Vault
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive row-level security on all new tables
- **Data Validation**: Check constraints for phone formats, postcodes, experience ranges
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of onboarding progress and changes

### Performance Optimizations
- **Strategic Indexes**: 12 new indexes for optimal query performance
- **GIN Indexes**: For array fields (service_postcodes, trade_secondary)
- **Composite Indexes**: For common query patterns
- **Chunked Migration**: Prevents timeout issues during deployment

### Developer Experience
- **Test Presets**: 5 onboarding scenarios for rapid testing
- **Deep Links**: Shareable URLs with complete context
- **No Page Reloads**: Seamless role switching in development
- **Comprehensive Docs**: 4 new documentation files with guides

## Current Metrics

### Codebase Health
- **Test Suite**: 86% pass rate (12/14 unit tests passing)
- **E2E Tests**: 42 tests configured (21 desktop + 21 mobile)
- **Coverage Target**: 80% lines/functions/statements, 70% branches
- **Documentation**: 100% up-to-date with recent changes

### Database Status
- **Tables**: 7 total (3 existing + 4 new onboarding tables)
- **Migration**: Ready for application (9 chunks prepared)
- **Indexes**: 12 performance indexes implemented
- **RLS Policies**: 100% coverage on user data

### Development Workflow
- **Dev Tools**: Fully functional with enhanced testing presets
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript types (post-migration generation needed)
- **Testing**: Improved workflow with context-aware presets
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for all phases

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks: LOW ⚠️
1. **Migration Application**: Requires careful execution of 9 chunks
2. **Type Generation**: Must regenerate TypeScript types post-migration
3. **Test Updates**: Some schema-dependent tests may need updates
4. **Twilio Vault**: Requires proper credential configuration

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Detailed Migration Guide**: Step-by-step instructions with verification queries
- **Chunked Approach**: Reduces risk of migration failures
- **Rollback Plan**: Clear documentation for reverting changes if needed
- **Testing Strategy**: Updated test requirements documented
