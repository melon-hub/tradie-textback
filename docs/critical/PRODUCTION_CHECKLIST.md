# Production Readiness Checklist

<!-- Updated: 2025-08-04 - Merged from PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md and PRODUCTION_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md -->

## Executive Summary

**Overall Status**: Strong MVP with excellent onboarding system, but **not yet production-ready**. Critical gaps exist in security, reliability, observability, and compliance.

## ✅ Resolved Issues

### 1. Profile Query Performance - FIXED ✅
**Previous Issue**: Profile queries were taking 30+ seconds
**Resolution**: Applied database indexes on 2025-08-02
**Results**: 
- 22x performance improvement (30s → 1.3s)
- No more timeout errors
- SessionStorage caching for instant subsequent loads
- Admin dashboard loads instantly

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_id ON profiles(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_type ON profiles(user_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_id_is_admin ON profiles(user_id, is_admin);
```

### 2. Onboarding System - COMPLETE ✅
- 6-step wizard with public signup flow
- Secure Twilio integration with Vault
- Professional SMS template library
- 106 passing tests with full coverage

## 🚨 Critical Issues (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities
- [ ] **Dependency vulnerabilities**: Run `npm audit fix` (7 vulnerabilities found)
- [ ] **CSP & Security Headers**: Not configured (X-Frame-Options, CSP, etc.)
- [ ] **Google Maps API**: Add referrer restrictions
- [ ] **Remove DevToolsPanel**: Must be disabled/removed for production
- [ ] **Admin toggle removal**: Remove lines 469-519 in DevToolsPanel.tsx
- [x] **SECURITY DEFINER View**: Fixed customer_jobs_view (migration 20250804152138)
- [x] **Function Search Paths**: Fixed all 5 functions with SET search_path (2025-08-04)

### 2. Auth Configuration (Low Priority - Using Magic Links)
- [ ] **OTP Expiry**: Currently >1 hour (only relevant if switching from magic links to OTP)
- [ ] **Leaked Password Protection**: Disabled (not relevant - app uses passwordless auth)
  - Note: If adding password auth in future, enable HaveIBeenPwned integration

### 3. Performance Optimizations (Low Priority - Post-Launch)
- [ ] **RLS Auth Optimization**: Replace auth.uid() with (SELECT auth.uid()) in 36 policies
  - Impact: Minor performance improvement for queries
  - Risk: High - could break RLS if done incorrectly
  - Recommendation: Fix after launch when performance matters
- [ ] **Duplicate Index**: Remove duplicate idx_profiles_user_id_btree
  - Simple fix: DROP INDEX idx_profiles_user_id_btree;
- [ ] **Multiple Policies**: Consider consolidating RLS policies
  - Current design is correct for multi-tenant (clients/tradies)
  - Only optimize if performance issues arise

### 4. User Impersonation System
- [ ] Implement proper backend impersonation system
  - Current implementation is development-only
  - Need server-side API to generate impersonation tokens
  - Should create temporary session without exposing credentials
- [ ] Add audit logging for all impersonation activities
- [ ] Add time limits on impersonation sessions
- [ ] Require re-authentication for sensitive actions

### 3. Legal & Compliance
- [ ] **GDPR/CCPA Compliance**: No consent management
- [ ] **Terms of Service**: Not present
- [ ] **Privacy Policy**: Not present
- [ ] **PII Retention Policy**: Not documented
- [ ] **Audit Trail**: No logging for critical actions

## 📋 Production Readiness Assessment

### Gate 1: Security ⚠️
- ✅ TLS/HTTPS (handled by Supabase)
- 🟡 OWASP Top-10 (partial - needs verification)
- 🟡 Secrets management (good practices, needs API key restrictions)
- 🟡 RBAC (client-side good, verify server-side RLS)
- ✅ Rate limiting (handled by Supabase)
- ❌ **Dependency scan** (vulnerabilities found)
- ❌ **Security headers** (not configured)
- ❌ **GDPR/CCPA** (no compliance measures)

### Gate 2: Reliability & Performance ⚠️
- 🟡 E2E tests (setup exists, coverage unverified)
- ❌ **Automated rollback** (manual deployment)
- ❌ **Error tracking** (no Sentry/LogRocket)
- ❌ **Monitoring & alerts** (not implemented)
- ❌ **Load testing** (not performed)
- ✅ Database indexes (performance optimized)

### Gate 3: UX / Accessibility ✅
- ✅ Mobile-first layouts (excellent)
- 🟡 WCAG AA (good foundation, needs audit)
- ✅ Error pages (custom 404)
- ❓ Performance metrics (needs testing)
- ✅ Keyboard navigation

### Gate 4: Data & Compliance ❌
- ✅ Backups (Supabase managed)
- ❌ **PII retention policy** (not documented)
- ❌ **Audit trail** (not implemented)
- ❌ **Legal documents** (ToS, Privacy Policy missing)

### Gate 5: DevOps & CI/CD ❌
- ❌ **CI/CD pipeline** (manual process)
- ✅ Infrastructure as Code (Supabase migrations)
- ❌ **Rollback capability** (not implemented)
- ❌ **Environment validation** (no CI)

### Gate 6: Observability ❌
- ❌ **Structured logging** (using console.log)
- ❌ **Metrics dashboard** (not implemented)
- ❌ **Business analytics** (not implemented)
- ❌ **APM** (no performance monitoring)

## 🎯 Immediate Action Items

### Week 1: Security & Legal
1. Run `npm audit fix` to resolve vulnerabilities
2. Implement security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options)
3. Add Google Maps API referrer restrictions
4. Create Terms of Service and Privacy Policy
5. Remove/disable DevToolsPanel for production

### Week 2: Reliability
