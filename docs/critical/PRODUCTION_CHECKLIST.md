# Production Checklist

## ✅ RESOLVED ISSUES

### 1. Profile Query Performance - FIXED ✅
**Previous Issue**: Profile queries were taking 30+ seconds
**Resolution**: Applied database indexes on 2025-08-02
**Results**: 
- 22x performance improvement (30s → 1.3s)
- No more timeout errors
- SessionStorage caching for instant subsequent loads
- Admin dashboard loads instantly

**Fix Applied**:
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_id ON profiles(user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_type ON profiles(user_type);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_profiles_user_id_is_admin ON profiles(user_id, is_admin);
```

## Remaining Tasks Before Production

### 1. Admin System Security
- [ ] **REMOVE** the admin toggle from DevToolsPanel (lines 469-519 in DevToolsPanel.tsx)
- [ ] Implement proper admin invitation system (only admins can create other admins)
- [ ] Add admin audit logging (nice to have, not blocking)

### 1.1 User Impersonation System
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement proper backend impersonation system
  - Current implementation is development-only (manual login required)
  - Need server-side API to generate impersonation tokens
  - Should create temporary session without exposing credentials
- [ ] Add audit logging for all impersonation activities
- [ ] Add time limits on impersonation sessions
- [ ] Require re-authentication for sensitive actions during impersonation

### 2. Environment & Configuration
- [ ] Move all sensitive data to environment variables
- [ ] Remove or disable DevToolsPanel entirely for production
- [ ] Set up proper CORS policies
- [ ] Configure rate limiting

### 3. Database Security
- [x] Apply all pending migrations properly - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Review and tighten RLS policies - ✅ FIXED RECURSION
- [ ] Remove any development-only database access
- [ ] Backup strategy in place

### 4. Authentication
- [ ] Review magic link expiration times
- [ ] Implement proper session management
- [ ] Add MFA for admin accounts (optional but recommended)

### 5. Technical Debt Status

#### Migration Sync Issues - RESOLVED ✅
**Previous Issue**: 12 migrations were out of sync
**Resolution**: All migrations successfully applied on 2025-08-02
**Current State**: 
- All 12 migrations are applied and in sync
- Performance indexes applied
- Admin features working
- No more sync errors

#### Admin Features - IMPLEMENTED ✅
**Status**: Complete UI implementation
**Working Features**:
- ✅ User management with search/filter/pagination
- ✅ Job management interface
- ✅ Analytics dashboard with charts
- ✅ Business settings form
- ✅ Twilio configuration UI

**Backend Enhancements (Nice to Have)**:
- [ ] Admin audit log table (not blocking)
- [ ] Database triggers for is_admin protection
- [ ] JWT claims for better auth

#### Confusing User Type Naming
- Current: `client` = tradie (business owner), `tradie` = admin
- Should be: `tradie` = business owner, `admin` = platform admin
- Requires database migration and code updates

### 6. Testing Before Production
- [x] Test all user flows (client, tradie, admin) - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Verify RLS policies work correctly - ✅ WORKING
- [ ] Load testing for expected traffic
- [ ] Security audit

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up admin action audit log alerts
- [ ] Database backup monitoring

## Files to Review Before Production
1. `/src/components/DevToolsPanel.tsx` - Remove admin toggle (lines 469-519)
2. `/.env.local` - Ensure not in version control
3. Remove development-only features:
   - Admin toggle in DevToolsPanel
   - Development-only impersonation code

## Completed Items Summary ✅
1. **Database Performance**: Fixed with indexes (30s → 1.3s)
2. **Migration Sync**: All 12 migrations applied successfully
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Fully implemented with all features
4. **Business Settings**: Complete UI for business configuration
5. **Twilio Settings**: Configuration interface ready
